We provide four sets of images for initial testing that can be accessed here:

The output of these images can be found with the corresponding labels for comparison with other methods. Poor alignment is generally due to high camera movement in the non-stitching direction, plant movement, or a frame rate too low for the amount of movement. If stitching fails, reducing the min_inliers will help ignore poor matching, but may result in lower quality. To improve stitching, try with a higher frame rate.
